# The results or output from the FEM-FD simulations
Here, the results of the two experimental designs "increasing gamma" and "increasing d" for the FEM-FD simulations are saved. These can be classified into two categories: the three metrics of cell polarisation and visualisation of the evolution of the concentration profile of active cdc42. 

## The three metrics of cell polarisation 
In figure the figures corresponding to the two experimental designs (see "Figures/increasing\_gamma" and "Figures/increasing\_d"), the effects of increasing the two parameters gamma and d on *three important metrics* is investigated. These three metrics are *the maximum and minimum concentration of active cdc42 on the cell membrane*, *the time to polarisation* and *the ratio of the area of the pole and the total area of the membrane*.
