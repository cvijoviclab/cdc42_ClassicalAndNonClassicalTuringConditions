# The figures presented in the repositry

There are five figures presented in the repositry with the following paths: 

1. "Figures/cdc42ModelSchematicFigure/combinedPictures.pdf",
2. "Figures/evolutionPattern/evolutionPattern.pdf",
3. the figures in "Figures/explanatoryFigures",
4. "Figures/Figures/paramPlot/parameterSpace.pdf",
5. "Figures/".

The first figure is made entirely in LaTeX (more precisely using Tikz and the diagram package) and contains reaction mechanisms of the activation of Cdc42. The second figure contains a simulation of the spatiotemporal evolution of the activation of Cdc42, and this depends on the outputs from the scripts "Code/FEMFD\_AlgorithmForSolvingTheRDsystem\_FEniCSandPython/increasing\_gamma/ScriptsToRun/mainFile.py" and "Code/FEMFD\_AlgorithmForSolvingTheRDsystem\_FEniCSandPython/increasing\_d/ScriptsToRun/mainFile.py" combined with Paraview (see "Results/README.md") which are a series of eps-figures. The third category of figures contains explanatory figures solely used in README-files in this repositry. The fourth figure visualises the Turing regions of the parameter space which depends on the outputs from the script "Code/MappingTheTuringParameterSpace\_Matlab/parameterSpacePlot\_NewtonIteration\_20190120.m" which are two eps-figures. Lastly,
